# amfoss-tasks

My name is narayan Binu and you should choose me because once i put my heart into something i dont settle until the work is done. I am quite dedicated and even with a bio background extremely intrested in coding and programming and stuff.

I intend to return back to the club by putting in my maximum effort into the development and growth of the club.

My fields of intrest in programming is mainly into cyber as i am a cyber student but as a complete starter to all this i am open to anything and everything and i am willing to take in any form as knowledge.
